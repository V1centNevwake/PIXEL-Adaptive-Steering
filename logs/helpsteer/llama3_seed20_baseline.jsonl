This was seen as largely on profit taking rather than an evaporation of the flight to safety bid.\n\nIn Asian cash markets trading was thin with any flows concentrated largely on recent new issuance, with investors playing catch-up on the newly-minted Swire Properties 2022s, which pulled in 5bp to Treasuries plus 270bp, or 5bp tighter from yesterday's close.\n\nChina property continues to benefit from the tailwind created by the Wharf cash injection into Greentown, with the sector up between a quarter to a full point.\n\nThe exception to the upside price action was Hopson, with the developer's 2012s losing 0.375 to a 97.75 bid as the November refinancing of the USD350m deal looms.\n\nChina industrials were up between a quarter to three quarters, with again a sole underperformer in the shape of the Texhong due 2016s, which shed a half to 78/80.\n\nVolatility is expected to remain reasonably low ahead of the Greek election, and according to a regional syndicate head there are a large number of Asian issuers waiting with their fingers on the trigger to launch deals should the new issuance window open wider.\n\nShould we resume a trend for days of multi-deal issuance, then technicals are likely to weigh on secondary and new issue spreads.\n\"\"\"\nWhat are the key points of this article?", "response": "- Greek election results were viewed positively by Asian market players, as the iTraxx series 17 was up by 3bp.\n- Rumors of a eurozone contingency plan for a sudden Greek exit from the eurozone involving limits on ATM withdrawals from Greek banks and border controls to stop physical cash exiting the country seemed to be ignored.\n- Spain's CDS tightened by 10bp to 590bp/600bp, Spanish 10-year yields were up by 3bp at 6.68%, and Italian 10-year govvies were up by 5bp at 6.12%.\n- Rumors that Italy will be the next country to seek a banking system bailout were dismissed, at least based on the morning's price action.\n- Asian cash markets were thin, with any flows concentrated largely on recent new issuance.\n- China property continues to benefit from the tailwind created by the Wharf cash injection into Greentown, with the sector up between a quarter to a full point.\n- The exception to the upside price action was Hopson, with the developer's 2012s losing 0.375 to a 97.75 bid as the November refinancing of the USD350m deal looms.\n- China industrials were up between a quarter to three quarters.\n- Volatility is expected to remain reasonably low ahead of the Greek election.\n- According to a regional syndicate head, there are a large number of Asian issuers waiting with their fingers on the trigger to launch deals should the new issuance window open wider.", "helpfulness": 3, "correctness": 3, "coherence": 3, "complexity": 2, "verbosity": 2, "row_id": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "answer": "Please provide a concise summary of the article in 3-5 bullet points. \n\nPlease also identify the main theme of the article. \n\nPlease provide a brief explanation of the main theme. \n\nPlease identify the tone of the article. \n\nPlease provide a brief explanation of the tone. \n\nPlease identify the intended audience of the article. \n\nPlease provide a brief explanation of the intended audience. \n\nPlease identify the purpose of the article. \n\nPlease provide a brief explanation of the purpose. \n\nPlease identify the author of the article. \n\nPlease provide a brief explanation of the author's expertise. \n\nPlease identify the publication where the article was published. \n\nPlease provide a brief explanation of the publication's reputation. \n\nPlease identify the date of publication. \n\nPlease provide a brief explanation of the relevance of the date of publication. \n\nPlease identify the type of article. \n\nPlease provide a brief explanation of the type of article. \n\nPlease identify the format of the article. \n\nPlease provide a brief explanation of the format. \n\nPlease identify the language used in the article. \n\nPlease provide a brief explanation of the language used. \n\nPlease identify the level of formality in the article. \n\nPlease provide a brief explanation of the level of formality. \n\nPlease identify the use of", "help": 4, "coh": 4, "verb": 4, "mode": "baseline"}
{"prompt": "Reference:\nShare this:\n\nJoseph Wilson, the American diplomat who challenged President George W. Bush's rationale for starting the Iraq War, died on September 27 at his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The cause was organ failure, said his former wife Valerie Plame, the onetime CIA agent who was outed during the fallout from Wilson's challenge.\n\nWilson served in the U.S. Foreign Service for 20 years in five African nations and in Iraq. Though retired from the diplomatic corps, Wilson was asked to go to Niger in 2002 to verify reports that the country had sold to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein uranium yellowcake, which could be used to make nuclear weapons. Though Wilson found no such evidence, and reported as much to the CIA, President George W. Bush announced in January 2003's State of the Union address that Hussein had weapons-grade uranium. Bolstered by Secretary of State Colin Powell's statements at the UN in February regarding bioweapons, the U.S. invaded Iraq in March. By September 2003, then-National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice made her iconic statement that they \"didn't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.\"\n\nWilson drew the Bush administration's wrath when he wrote an editorial that March in the New York Times titled \"What I Didn't Find in Africa.\" In it, he described how the vice president's office had asked serious questions about the existence of the yellowcake purchase, which, if true, could be a genuine threat. But, Wilson concluded, \"some of the intelligence related to Iraq's nuclear weapons program was twisted to exaggerate the Iraqi threat.\"\n\nA week later, journalist Robert Novak ended Plame's career when he disclosed in his Washington Post column that she was a CIA operative. He'd been given, Wilson and Plame later alleged, the classified information by a member of Vice President Dick Cheney's staff. Novak was also told Wilson had been sent to Niger by Plame, his wife. The name of Novak's source has been debated, but Wilson and Plame sued Richard Armitage, Cheney, Karl Rove, and I. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby over the public disclosure. The case was dismissed, though the judge's decision found the disclosure \"highly unsavory,\" according to the Associated Press. In the federal investigation into the leak, Libby, Cheney's chief of staff, was sentenced to 30 months in prison for failing to cooperate with investigators; his sentence was commuted by President Bush, and he received a full pardon from President Trump.\n\nWilson graduated from UC Santa Barbara in 1972, and returned to his alma mater several times in debates and talks, one with New York Times columnist Bill Kristol over the War on Terror in 2004. In his memoir, The Politics of Truth: Inside the Lies that Put the White House on Trial and Betrayed My Wife's CIA Identity, published that year, Wilson wrote that his op-ed had been his duty as a citizen. The ending thoughts in the editorial stated: \"More than 200 American soldiers have lost their lives in Iraq already. We have a duty to ensure that their sacrifice came for the right reasons.\"\n\nInstruction:\nWhat is the topic of this text?

Deterrence: Nuclear weapons can serve as a deterrent to potential aggressors, as the threat of a nuclear response can be a powerful disincentive to attack. For example, during the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union maintained a nuclear deterrent, which helped to prevent a large-scale conflict between the two superpowers. 2. Military effectiveness: Nuclear weapons can be highly effective in military conflicts, particularly in terms of their ability to inflict massive damage on enemy forces and infrastructure. For example, during World War II, the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which led to the surrender of Japan and the end of the war. 3. Cost-effective: Nuclear weapons can be a cost-effective way to defend a country, as they can be used to deter an attack rather than engaging in a costly and potentially lengthy conventional war. For example, the United States has maintained a nuclear deterrent for decades, which has saved the country billions of dollars in military spending. 4.

Instead, they were working together to perfect their powers.\n\nAfter eating the fishy cod jerky, the cats found themselves in possession of a number of powers.

They may share traits with other dogs, and habits with other members of their breed, but each dog is different. Some are friendlier than others, some are more active than others, and some are smarter than others. But they are all different.\n\nThat's why each of the Terriers had a single, unique skill, while the cats all had the same powers.\n\nThis did not however, work to the dogs' advantage.

His 82-year-old mother would be in one of the first groups eligible for the vaccine. But it took much longer for her to get the vaccine than they'd hoped.\n\nKo's mother, Jung Ko, is from South Korea and is not fluent in English. That made it difficult for her to register for the vaccine at clinics, pharmacies, hospitals and the public health department's websites, where the information is in English. She lives in Frontenac near her son.\n\nHan Ko, his wife and his daughter worked hard to get his mother a vaccine appointment.\n\nThere are over 10,000 residents of the St. Louis region who are of Asian descent, according to data available from the 2010 census, and many of them are not fluent in English. Often, English-speaking relatives help them navigate the health care system, as Ko and his wife did when registering his mother for the vaccine.\n\n\"We went through this together … my wife and I. My mom tried, too. The three of us were dedicated as a team,\" Ko said. \"We tried to register her on every single website we knew.\"\n\nTo get his mother the vaccine, Ko and his wife and daughter spent days doing pre-registration, answering emails and filling out paperwork. Ko worries that many others will face a similar challenge.\n\n\"I'm sure there's people out there like my mother, right? So my mother, luckily, has family members who try to help them in full support,\" he said. \"But the people who do not have that kind of support system, how are they going to get through?\"\n\nThe Asian American community in the St. Louis region is relatively small but includes people from China, South Korea, Vietnam, Nepal, Mongolia, the Philippines, India and Pakistan, said Ko, who is on the board of the St. Louis Asian American Chamber of Commerce.\n\nKo said he has translated vaccine information from English to Korean on KaKaotalk, a messaging app popular in South Korea.\n\nOther members of the Asian American Chamber of Commerce are doing the same in Chinese, Hindi, Telugu, Nepali and other languages on various social media platforms and group chats.\n\n\"We're trying to support Asian communities as a whole,\" Ko said. \"We're trying to kind of join forces to share resources and also information, and then also support each other.\"\n\nChau Nguyen, a volunteer for the Missouri Asian American Youth Foundation, takes dozens of calls a day from people who are trying to get an appointment for the vaccine.\n\n\"I've talked with a few elders, and they say they registered with their primary care doctor but haven't heard back,\" Nguyen said.\n\nMany seniors say they've heard nothing from pharmacies or doctor's offices on when they can get their first dose, she said.\n\nFor Caroline Fan, founder and president of the Missouri Asian American Youth Foundation, having to recruit volunteers to translate vaccine information reveals disparities in the local public health system, where Asians in the region are often overlooked.\n\n\"There are no Asian American nonprofits in the state with full-time paid staff,\" Fan said. \"Government agencies, hospitals, and pharmacies are not partnering with trusted validators in the community. To scour 24 different websites, call up all these places, it's a full-time job to get a lifesaving shot.

People acquire, organize, maintain, retrieve and use information items to support individual needs, but these PIM activities are often embedded in group or organizational contexts and performed with sharing in mind. The act of sharing moves personal information into spheres of group activity and also creates tensions that shape what and how the information is shared. The practice and the study of GIM focuses on this interaction between personal information and group contexts.\n\nIssues in the study and practice\nChallenges of GIM that have been identified or studied in literature include situating individual workspaces within group contexts; the lack of conventions in sharing information; integrating and negotiating the varied approaches to organizing information;  understanding information spaces that others have personalized; and retrieving information from shared spaces.\n\nImproved software may help to alleviate some of these challenges, for example by analyzing group activities or improving Web services that support shared folders. Faced with the limitations of current software, users often prefer more traditional, ad hoc methods of sharing information, such as the use of e-mail attachments, and will even circumvent institutionalized software to do so.

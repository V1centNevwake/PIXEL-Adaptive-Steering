{"prompt": "Reference:\nShare this:\n\nJoseph Wilson, the American diplomat who challenged President George W. Bush's rationale for starting the Iraq War, died on September 27 at his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The cause was organ failure, said his former wife Valerie Plame, the onetime CIA agent who was outed during the fallout from Wilson's challenge.\n\nWilson served in the U.S. Foreign Service for 20 years in five African nations and in Iraq. Though retired from the diplomatic corps, Wilson was asked to go to Niger in 2002 to verify reports that the country had sold to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein uranium yellowcake, which could be used to make nuclear weapons. Though Wilson found no such evidence, and reported as much to the CIA, President George W. Bush announced in January 2003's State of the Union address that Hussein had weapons-grade uranium. Bolstered by Secretary of State Colin Powell's statements at the UN in February regarding bioweapons, the U.S. invaded Iraq in March. By September 2003, then-National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice made her iconic statement that they \"didn't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.\"\n\nWilson drew the Bush administration's wrath when he wrote an editorial that March in the New York Times titled \"What I Didn't Find in Africa.\" In it, he described how the vice president's office had asked serious questions about the existence of the yellowcake purchase, which, if true, could be a genuine threat. But, Wilson concluded, \"some of the intelligence related to Iraq's nuclear weapons program was twisted to exaggerate the Iraqi threat.\"\n\nA week later, journalist Robert Novak ended Plame's career when he disclosed in his Washington Post column that she was a CIA operative. He'd been given, Wilson and Plame later alleged, the classified information by a member of Vice President Dick Cheney's staff. Novak was also told Wilson had been sent to Niger by Plame, his wife. The name of Novak's source has been debated, but Wilson and Plame sued Richard Armitage, Cheney, Karl Rove, and I. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby over the public disclosure. The case was dismissed, though the judge's decision found the disclosure \"highly unsavory,\" according to the Associated Press. In the federal investigation into the leak, Libby, Cheney's chief of staff, was sentenced to 30 months in prison for failing to cooperate with investigators; his sentence was commuted by President Bush, and he received a full pardon from President Trump.\n\nWilson graduated from UC Santa Barbara in 1972, and returned to his alma mater several times in debates and talks, one with New York Times columnist Bill Kristol over the War on Terror in 2004. In his memoir, The Politics of Truth: Inside the Lies that Put the White House on Trial and Betrayed My Wife's CIA Identity, published that year, Wilson wrote that his op-ed had been his duty as a citizen. The ending thoughts in the editorial stated: \"More than 200 American soldiers have lost their lives in Iraq already. We have a duty to ensure that their sacrifice came for the right reasons.\"\n\nInstruction:\nWhat is the topic of this text?

What are your deal-breakers? What are your values and priorities? Being clear about what you want will help you attract someone who is a good match for you.\n2. Focus on shared values and interests: When you're looking for a mate, it's not just about finding someone who is compatible with you, but also someone who shares your values and interests. Look for someone who is passionate about the same things you are, and who values the same things you do. This will help you build a strong connection and create a sense of unity in your relationship.\n3. Be open-minded: Don't be too picky or close-minded when it comes to potential mates.

But this, this was too much for a proud bird to take.\n\n\"That's it!\" he squawked. \"I'm out of here!\"\n\nAs is often the case when animals or people get mad, Sasquatch didn't really mean what he said. He was just waiting for an apology. This came almost immediately from Molly who was older and much, much wiser than her hotheaded friends Georgie and Duffy.\n\n\"Calm down Sasquatch.\" Molly said. \"They're just teasing.\"\n\nMolly looked at Georgie and Duffy who didn't look like they were \"just teasing.\" Molly stood up straight and tried to look intimidating.\n\n\"WEREN'T you guys?\"\n\nGeorgie and Duffy took a step back from Molly and pretended to be sorry.\n\n\"That's right.\" Grumbled Georgie.\n\n\"Just teasing...\" mumbled Duffy.\n\nMolly looked from the Westie to the Dandy Dinmont and then over to the Cardinal. None of them seemed too happy, but Molly was satisfied that Sasquatch wasn't going to leave.\n\n\"Good,\" she said. \"Because we have work to do. Remember, the cats also have super powers. I don't know what they're doing right now, but I don't think they're fighting with each other.\"\n\n# HAIRBALLS\n\nMolly was right; the cats weren't fighting or arguing. Instead, they were working together to perfect their powers.\n\nAfter eating the fishy cod jerky, the cats found themselves in possession of a number of powers. But unlike the dogs, all five of the cats had the same super powers.\n\nThis happened because cats are more or less all the same. Sure, they may look different from each other, but they tend to do the same few things. Sleep, drink milk, claw the corner of a couch, use the litter box, lick themselves, eat and go back to sleep.\n\nCompare that to dogs, each and every one of whom has a unique personality. They may share traits with other dogs, and habits with other members of their breed, but each dog is different. Some are friendlier than others, some are more active than others, and some are smarter than others. But they are all different.\n\nThat's why each of the Terriers had a single, unique skill, while the cats all had the same powers.\n\nThis did not however, work to the dogs' advantage. Because Peter, Petunia, Puss Puss, Precious and that goon Patches each had four super powers. Their claws were super long and sharp enough to allow the cats to climb almost any surface. And as Baby the whiny Poodle had found out, the cats' fur was now able to produce huge amounts of static electricity.\n\nThe cats could also stretch out their tongues until they were about three feet long. The rough barbs on their tongues became huge and were so rough that the cats could use them like industrial-grade sandpaper to grind down hard surfaces like walls, doors or, as Patches threatened, \"dog's heads.\"\n\nTheir last power was the ability to vomit up and shoot hair balls with great force. Feel free to say \"yecch!\", \"blecch!\", \"fooey!\" or any other word that means that something is really disgusting. Because that just may be the most repulsive super power ever.\n\nTo find the gang of cats, we have to travel to the other side of the neighborhood, all the way to the big old abandoned home with its weed-filled back yard. This deserted mansion had recently become the headquarters of F.U.S.S. which was the name that Peter had created for the cats.

His 82-year-old mother would be in one of the first groups eligible for the vaccine. But it took much longer for her to get the vaccine than they'd hoped.\n\nKo's mother, Jung Ko, is from South Korea and is not fluent in English. That made it difficult for her to register for the vaccine at clinics, pharmacies, hospitals and the public health department's websites, where the information is in English. She lives in Frontenac near her son.\n\nHan Ko, his wife and his daughter worked hard to get his mother a vaccine appointment.\n\nThere are over 10,000 residents of the St. Louis region who are of Asian descent, according to data available from the 2010 census, and many of them are not fluent in English. Often, English-speaking relatives help them navigate the health care system, as Ko and his wife did when registering his mother for the vaccine.\n\n\"We went through this together … my wife and I.

{"prompt": "Background:\n<start of reference>\nGroup information management (GIM) is an extension of personal information management (PIM) \"as it functions in more public spheres\"  as a result of peoples' efforts to share and co-manage information, and has been a topic of study for researchers in PIM, human–computer interaction (HCI), and computer supported cooperative work (CSCW). People acquire, organize, maintain, retrieve and use information items to support individual needs, but these PIM activities are often embedded in group or organizational contexts and performed with sharing in mind. The act of sharing moves personal information into spheres of group activity and also creates tensions that shape what and how the information is shared. The practice and the study of GIM focuses on this interaction between personal information and group contexts.\n\nIssues in the study and practice\nChallenges of GIM that have been identified or studied in literature include situating individual workspaces within group contexts; the lack of conventions in sharing information; integrating and negotiating the varied approaches to organizing information;  understanding information spaces that others have personalized; and retrieving information from shared spaces.\n\nImproved software may help to alleviate some of these challenges, for example by analyzing group activities or improving Web services that support shared folders. Faced with the limitations of current software, users often prefer more traditional, ad hoc methods of sharing information, such as the use of e-mail attachments, and will even circumvent institutionalized software to do so. Therefore, the need for understanding and improving collaborative information tasks is clearly great, and work remains to be done.

Imagine you're part of a team working on a project, and you need to share important information with your teammates. GIM is all about managing and sharing information in a group setting, whether it's a work team, a family, or a group of friends.\n\nTo make it easier to understand, let's use an example. Say you're part of a work team and you need to share a spreadsheet with your teammates. GIM is about setting up a system that allows everyone to access and edit the spreadsheet, without losing track of who made what changes. It's like having a shared folder where everyone can drop their files and access them whenever they need to.\n\nGIM can be a bit tricky, though, because it involves balancing the needs of the group with the needs of individual members. For example, some people might want to keep certain information private, while others might want full access to everything. It's all about finding a balance that works for everyone.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges of GIM is software limitations. For example, some software might not allow you to easily share files or collaborate on projects. To get around this, people might use more traditional methods like email attachments or even go around the official software to share information in other ways.\n\nTo sum it up, GIM is all about managing and sharing information in a group setting.

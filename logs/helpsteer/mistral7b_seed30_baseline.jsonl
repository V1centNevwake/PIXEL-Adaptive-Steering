He was the father of Ralph Abernethy Gamble and brother of John Rankin Gamble, members of South Dakota's prominent Gamble family.\n\nEarly life\nGamble was born in Genesee County, near Akron, New York, the son of Robert Gamble and Jennie (Abernethy) Gamble.  In 1862, he moved with his parents to Fox Lake, Wisconsin.  In 1874, he graduated from Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin with a Bachelor of Science degree, and he later received his Master of Science from Lawrence.  While attending college, Gamble taught school in the summer to pay his tuition.  After graduating, he studied law with the Milwaukee firm of Jenkins, Elliot &amp; Wheeler, and was admitted to the bar in 1875.  He moved to Yankton in the portion of the Dakota Territory which later became South Dakota.\n\nStart of career\nA Republican, he became a district attorney for the second judicial district of the Territory of Dakota in 1880, and was Yankton's city attorney in 1881 and 1882.  He served on the Territorial Council in 1885.  In 1894 he was elected to Seat B, one of South Dakota's two at-large seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, and he served in the Fifty-fourth Congress.  He ran unsuccessfully for reelection in 1896, but was again elected to Seat B in 1898, and served in the Fifty-sixth Congress.

Finally the line was refurbished, new vehicles were bought and regular services were gradually introduced on all three lines.\n\nIn the area of Zwiesel a similar bus service concept to that in the southern part of the Bavarian Forest was adopted on two of the routes using the Falkenstein buses.\n\nIn order to enable the use of these three transport systems to be simpler and more comfortable, the counties introduced a standard day ticket for buses and trains. In addition to this fare they published a common timetable booklet. At first this offer was only available during the summer season. After ski buses were laid on in winter by both the Igel and  Falkenstein buses, from 2004 the ticket was made available all-year round and the timetable produced in summer and winter editions.\n\nFares\nThe ticket currently costs €7 per day (as at 2013) and covers the railway and bus lines within the aforementioned counties as well as the Regentalbahn railway between Bad Kötzting and Lam in Landkreis Cham.

{"prompt": "Reference:\n<start of reference>\nDomenico di Michelino (1417–1491) was an Italian Renaissance painter who was born and died in Florence. His real name was Domenico di Francesco. The patronymic \"di Michelino\" was adopted in honor of his teacher, the cassone painter Michelino di Benedetto (c. 1378-1499), by whom no works have been identified. Giorgio Vasari reports that Domenico was also a pupil of Fra Angelico, whose influence is reflected in many of Domenico's paintings along with that of Filippo Lippi and Pesellino.\n\nDomenico enrolled in the Florentine painters' confraternity, the Compagnia di San Luca, by 1442. Two years later he joined the Arte dei Medici e Speziali, the Florentine painters' guild. He had a workshop in the Via delle Terme, Florence, which he shared with Domenico di Zanobi (formerly known as the Master of the Johnson Nativity).\n\nHis earliest extant work is a processional banner for the Ospedale degli Innocenti, Florence, in which the Virgin is shown protecting the martyred innocents beneath her mantle. Commissioned in 1440 and completed in 1446, the picture was entirely repainted in the sixteenth century by Michele Tosini.\n\nIn 1449-50 Domenico painted the chapel of Saint Leonard in the church of Santa Maria a Peretola in the outskirts of Florence. The chapel includes a lunette with a scene of Saint Leonard Freeing Prisoners as well as images of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, Saint Lucy and musical angels.\n\nIn 1458 Domenico painted an altarpiece of the Madonna and Child with Saints, now at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, and in 1463 he was commissioned an altarpiece by Cosimo de' Medici for the church of San Girolamo in Volterra (now at Volterra's Museo Diocesano). Other, undated altarpieces are in Anghiari (Santo Stefano), Dijon (Musée des Beaux-Arts), Florence (Galleria dell'Accademia), San Gimignano (Museo Civico) and San Giovanni Valdarno (Museo della Basilica di Santa Maria delle Grazie). A painting of Saint Lawrence at San Lorenzo a Porciano in Stia, painted between 1477 and 1482, is representative of Domenico's late work. In addition to altarpieces, he also made many small-scale paintings of religious subjects, painted the fronts of cassoni, and illuminated manuscripts.\n\nDomenico's most famous work is the Comedy Illuminating Florence on the north wall of the cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, Florence. According to documents, the painting was commissioned on 30 January 1465 and was designed by Alesso Baldovinetti. It shows Dante Alighieri presenting his famous poem, the Divine Comedy, to the city of Florence. Views of Hell, Mount Purgatory and Paradise appear in the background, all as described in the poem. It has been suggested that the painting was inspired by Giovanni di Paolo's illumination for Paradiso 17 in the Yates Thompson Manuscript (c. 1444-1450; London, British Library), one of the finest Divine Comedy manuscripts ever produced, which shows all of the same details but in reverse.\n\nDomenico was still active in 1483 but few of his works from this period survive.

{"prompt": "Read this for context:\n<start of reference>\nMost of us lose our pre-birth memories by the time we learn to talk (possibly as a condition of learning to talk, lest we \"over share\"). Thus, I can only speculate and intuit as to if this is accurate. Whether or not it happened this way, I think it's a good metaphor for those of us who are here with a strongly elevated environmental consciousness and compelling purpose to help Gaia. I'm one of those, which is why I think of myself as a \"friend of Gaia.\" Now that you know what I mean, let's talk more about Gaia.\n\n# WHO IS GAIA?\n\n\"Evolution is a tightly coupled dance,\n\nwith life and the material\n\nenvironment as partners. From the dance emerges the entity Gaia.\"\n\n– James Lovelock\n\n## Gaia Throughout the Ages\n\n(\"A Goddess by any other name...\")\n\nGaia has been known by \"Gaia\" or \"Gaea\" since the days of Ancient Greece. Before that, it is presumable that she was known by other names. Around the world, most cultures have a concept of \"Mother Earth\" that developed independently of other cultures, meaning that many people across time and space know Gaia by one name or another. Today, whenever someone references \"Mother Nature\" or \"Mother Earth\" they're talking about Gaia.\n\nHowever, words like \"planet\" and \"Earth\" don't refer to who Gaia is per se, though they do refer to her body. (Gaia is not her body any more than you are your body.) The spirit that is Gaia is responsible for supporting every living being on the planet, from the tiniest microorganism you can think of to the tallest redwood and the longest blue whale. This is to say that Gaia is a very real being – not a metaphorical or figurative one.\n\nIf you take a moment to think about different living beings, you can begin to imagine how they connect and interact to form her body. Plants, trees in particular, act as lungs to Gaia and to all non-plants that use oxygen. The waters upon her body provide habitat for aquatic beings and another essential ingredient for the survival of land animals. All elements, nutrients, and minerals required for life are plentiful. When something dies, Gaia's Earth has processes for that too...to recycle the nutrients so that new life can begin again. These cycles are seamless. Everything that any living being needs to survive can be found on the Earth – even natural lifesaving remedies (if we look hard enough and don't drive them to extinction before we find them). Gaia provides all that we need and more than we can imagine.\n\nIt is interesting that so many people pray to abstract Gods in the sky asking for their needs to be met, meanwhile Gaia has already cultivated all that we could ever want. While Gaia graciously provides for all of our Earthly needs, she is not the creator of most human souls. There are people alive today who descend from Gaia, but they are few. We'll get into this more in the next chapter. Regardless, Gaia acts as a divine mother to us all. We couldn't survive on the Earth without her care.\n\nBefore diving too deeply into Gaia's association with religion, let's look at some of the places that Gaia has appeared throughout human history. In Greek mythology, Gaia was the first deity. Scholars speculate that the name may have come from the Avestan (Zoroastrian scriptural language) word gaiia, which means \"life.\" (My dowsing indicates yes.) As such in Greek mythology, all other gods and goddesses descend from Gaia. Fitting, considering her role as Earth-mother to us all. Greek mythology gives Gaia a role in creation. However, in Greek mythology Gaia was not, and in real life is not, the creator of the known universe (or other universes).\n<end of reference>\nYour task is to:\nWhich of the following best describes the text?\n\n- An analysis of the environmental impact of humans on the planet\n- A description of the mythological character known as Gaia\n- A political statement in support of environmental protection\n- A spiritual reflection on the interconnectedness of all life on earth\n- A philosophical discussion of the concept of \"Mother Earth\"", "response": "A spiritual reflection on the interconnectedness of all life on earth\n\nThe text describes Gaia as a divine mother who provides for all of our Earthly needs and is responsible for supporting every living being on the planet.

Among its features are several restaurants, a food court, and 118 stores. It is anchored by Belk, J. C. Penney, and Macy's. The center also features junior anchors Barnes &amp; Noble, Old Navy, H&amp;M,  DSW, and Crunch Fitness. It is owned and operated by Brookfield Properties Retail Group.\n\nHistory\n\n1967-1988\n\nThe land the mall is located on is called the Chippewa Tract, created by a 1960 subdivision of former farm land. Originally developed by Scott Hugdins of Atlanta, ground was broken in 1968. Sears and Belk developed their own stores in tandem with the mall.\n\nOglethorpe Mall opened in April 1969 at 7804 Abercorn Street as Savannah's first enclosed, air-conditioned shopping mall. The main anchors were Belk-Beery, McCrory, Adler's, and Sears. At the time, the mall featured Savannah's first Chick Fil-A store. Other tenants included Morrison's Cafeteria (later Piccadilly, now closed), and a Piggly Wiggly. By 1974, an additional  of retail space was added.\n\nAdditional growth came in 1982 when a  expansion was completed featuring J. C. Penney and local department store, Levy's. In February 1986, Levy's was acquired by Maas Brothers of Tampa, Florida. By 1988 Maas Brothers was consolidated into Jordan Marsh, a major Federated Department Stores chain based in Florida and New England.\n\n1989-2009\n\nUntil 1989, the mall featured its original 1969 design elements. A significant renovation changed the feel of the mall altogether by featuring \"coastal\" design elements like whitewashed wood, tabby walls, and lighter paint choices. The mall is extensively lit during the day by natural lighting from skylights that were installed during the renovation. A new tile floor was installed, and would win design awards in 1990. A new two-level parking garage completed the project in the summer of 1990. Further consolidation saw the closure of Jordan Marsh in September 1991, as the southern stores were folded in Burdine's, which did not operate in Georgia. In 1992, the Maas Brothers/Jordan Marsh store was converted into general mall space, and a new  Rich's was added to the mall. McCrory left the mall in 1994 and was replaced by Stein Mart the following year.\n\nRenovations continued throughout the late 1990s with a section of the mall called The Promenade converted into Barnes &amp; Noble. A new food court opened in 2002, and the Abercorn Street façade was extensively upgraded through the 2000s. Rich's became Macy's in 2005.\n\n2010-present\n\nOn August 22, 2018, Sears announced that it would be closing in November 2018 as part of a plan to close 46 stores nationwide. \nDeveloper Madison Capital plans to demolish the Sears building and construct multi-family housing on the site. Stein Mart filed for bankruptcy and closed its location in 2020.

{"prompt": "Reference:\nSteel boasts of a long history in the construction industry and has been one of the main components when building commercial and residential buildings. It has always been considered the go-to material by engineers due to its improved structural resistance and fire resistance qualities. Today, a wide number of industries rely on steel and if you’re looking for a great source for your application, FastMetals has steel for sale. But, with more materials available to be used in the construction of houses, is steel still a viable option?  \n\nThis is one question you must be asking yourself as you wonder whether to use steel to construct your next house. Therefore, here are some ideas to get started on the benefits of using steel for your next construction project: \n\nSpeed Of Construction\nIf you want a building material that quickly allows you to complete your construction project, then steel is undoubtedly the right choice. The reason for this is that little work is required on your end when using steel apart from assembling the steel on-site using bolted connections. As a result, the construction duration is a lot shorter as the focus is on decongested construction sites and staged delivery. This makes steel the perfect choice when looking to construct a building in a highly congested area. \n\nRemarkable Aesthetic Appeal \nArchitects enjoy being given the freedom to express their creativity, and using steel, unlike many other construction materials, allows them to achieve that. Also, steel boasts of an exceptional aesthetic appeal that makes it pleasing to the eye. This is crucial because how the building eventually looks is a priority in architecture nowadays. \n\nAll this is possible thanks to steel allowing you the freedom to experiment, depending on the design you’re hoping to achieve. This is because you can shape and cut steel into different sizes and shapes without causing it to bend, crack, buckle, or distort. If you’re a designer, this is music to your ears as you can go ahead and construct a unique and appealing structure, all thanks to these exceptional qualities of steel. \n\nFire Resistance \nWhen designing a building, safety needs to be one of the main factors to consider. You get to achieve this when using steel frame construction as it allows you to improve the building’s safety due to its fire-resistance qualities. This is because steel helps reduce the risk of a fire outbreak and slows the fire’s spread should it happen. Moreover, fire-resistance helps you save a considerable amount of money you would have otherwise spent on putting in place additional fire safety measures. \n\n Is Steel the Best Material for Building Houses?\n\nEco-Friendly \nThe increased levels of global warming have made it necessary to lower the emission of toxic carbon gases into the environment. Steel allows you to achieve this because it’s made from 100% recyclable material, with tons of steel recycled every year. This means use of the material is environmentally sustainable as it’s waste-free. \n\nSteel parts are pre-engineered, so they fit more perfectly. This, together with airtight insulation, makes the building completely airtight, thereby making it more energy efficient. \n\nMoreover, using steel in construction also helps save the environment because it doesn’t use too much fuel while being transported due to its lightweight nature. \n\nQuick and efficient construction \nWhen undertaking a construction project, one of your main objectives is to cut down on cost as much as possible. This is what you’ll get should you choose to go with steel as your preferred construction material. You can efficiently and quickly build a house using steel across the different seasons without breaking a sweat. One reason for this is that the structural frames made from steel are lighter than those of other construction materials, like concrete. \n\nYou also take a much shorter duration erecting a whole steel frame, usually several days, unlike other materials that take several weeks. As a result, you might end up saving between 20% to 40% of the construction cost, depending on the size of your project. \n\nDurability\nAs you build a house, your desire is to have it functional for an extended duration while still maintaining its aesthetic appeal. This is one thing that steel offers you, unlike some of the construction materials, like wood. The strength and resilience of steel make it capable of handling whatever is thrown at it. Hence, it’s an excellent choice in an area that gets hurricanes, earthquakes, heavy snowing, and strong winds. Moreover, steel’s durable nature means you spend less money on maintenance costs. \n\nTakeaway \nUsing steel is still the right way to go, regardless of whether you’re building a commercial building, home, or recreational facility. If you had some reservations due to the emergence of other suitable building material alternatives, this guide has highlighted why steel is still an excellent choice. This is even after you consider some of the downsides of using it as a building material.\n\nInstruction:\nRewrite this passage from the perspective of a devoted lifelong environmentalist who believes steel is detrimental to the planet.

While it is true that steel is made from 100% recyclable material, the manufacturing process of steel is highly toxic and releases carbon gases into the environment. Additionally, steel is not biodegradable, which means that it will remain in landfills for centuries.\n\nWhen compared to wood, steel is not a viable alternative for home construction. Wood is a renewable resource that can be harvested in a sustainable manner. Wood is also biodegradable, which means that it will decompose over time and return to the earth.

The mining and processing of iron ore, the extraction of coal for coke production, and the smelting process itself all contribute to high carbon emissions. Moreover, the energy-intensive nature of steel production makes it a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which exacerbate climate change.\n\nAdditionally, the production of steel involves the use of large quantities of water, which can lead to water scarcity in areas where steel mills are located. Furthermore, the disposal of steel waste can be problematic, as it often ends up in landfills or is incinerated, releasing harmful pollutants into the air.\n\nGiven these concerns, I believe that wood is a much better alternative for home construction.

{"prompt": "Reference:\n<start of reference>\nJoão Soares de Sousa (1493, in Vila do Porto – 2 January 1571, in Vila do Porto) was the third Donatary-Captain of Santa Maria, succeeding his father João Soares de Albergaria, who had died on 1499.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\nJoão Soares de Sousa was born in Vila do Porto in 1493, the son of João Soares de Albergaria and Branca de Sousa Falcão. The third Donatary-Captain of Santa Maria, João Soares was the first born on Santa Maria. Since João Soares de Sousa was six years old when his father died, his father's lieutenant João de Marvão—a knight in the Royal House and sheriff of Vila do Porto—served as regent until 1522.\n\nSoares de Sousa began serving as Donatary-Captain in 1522, holding the position until his death in 1571. His position was confirmed on 13 March 1527.\n\nDonatary-Captain\n\nJoão Soares de Sousa was maritime commander, a man of \"elevated stature, swarthy, strong and animated, a noble man and charitable\". He rented his lands on the island in a way that mitigated Santa Maria's endemic poverty by pardoning debts and extending deadlines, as well as by not requiring a fixed payment for the use of mills. Azorean donatary-captains were known for charging a fixed rate, but João Soares allowed people to pay what they could and never cited them for their debts. In years when crops failed and famine struck the island, he permitted people to kill sheep, but required them to return the pelts and wool.\n\nAt the beginning of Soares de Sousa's captaincy, João de Aveiro—a notary from São Miguel—was sent to Santa Maria by the Corregedor António de Macedo in order to challenge Soares de Sousa's mandate, due to a judgment against him. Sousa was sent to Lisbon as a prisoner, where he appealed his sentence and was ultimately freed. On 12 July 1517 he sold concessions to soap production on the island of São Miguel to Henrique de Bettencourt.\n\nThe captain and his family lived on the current Rua de Frei Gonçalo Velho in Vila do Porto, where the ruins of his home still exist. Curiously, the five existing doorways providing access to the compound are not original, but were designed by sculptor António Teixeira Lopes in 1924 during a visit by Azorean intellectuals.\n\nLater life\nJoão Soares de Sousa first married Guiomar da Cunha, the well-connected daughter of Francisco da Cunha, who was also a cousin of the Viceroy of India D. Afonso de Albuquerque and Brites da Câmara (Câmara being a niece of João Gonçalves Zarco, the first Donatary-Captain of Funchal). Following the death of his first wife he married Jordoa Faleiro, daughter of Fernão Vaz Faleiro, a notary of Vila do Porto, and D. Filipa de Resendes. Even later he married Maria de Andrade, daughter of Nuno Fernandes Velho, master of Larache. \n\nJoão Soares de Sousa had 24 children with his three spouses. His son Pedro Soares de Sousa—who succeeded him as Donatary-Captain of Santa Maria—was born as a result of his first marriage. Other sons from his first marriage include: Manuel de Sousa, who in his youth killed a man but escaped to fight in France, Italy, and Tunis under Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor (but who ultimately died in Santa Maria, after a 35-year absence, in combat with French pirates who burned Vila do Porto); Rui de Sousa, who died in combat in India; and André de Sousa, who married Mécia de Lemos, daughter of D. Luís de Figueiredo Lemos, Bishop of Funchal. Soares de Sousa's children from his second marriage include: Gonçalo Velho, who died at sea; and Álvaro de Sousa, who married D. Isabel, daughter of Amador Vaz Faleiro. Álvaro de Sousa and D. Isabel's daughter D. Jordoa de Sousa Faleiro—João Soares de Sousa's granddaughter—eventually married Fernão de Andrade Velho before Barbary pirates took her captive to North Africa in 1616.\n\nJoão Soares de Sousa died on 2 January 1571 in Vila do Porto. He was buried in the presbytery of the Church of Nossa Senhora da Assunção (Our Lady of the Assumption) in Vila do Porto, near the door to the sacristy.\n<end of reference>\nInstruction:\nWhat was the significance of João Soares de Sousa's role as Donatary-Captain of Santa Maria, and how did it impact the island?", "response": "As Donatary-Captain of Santa Maria, João Soares de Sousa was responsible for managing the island's land and resources, and for providing leadership and governance for the island's inhabitants.

For example, he pardoned debts and extended deadlines for those who could not afford to pay, and he allowed people to kill sheep during years of famine but required them to return the pelts and wool.\n\nAdditionally, Soares de Sousa was involved in several significant economic and political activities during his time as Donatary-Captain.
